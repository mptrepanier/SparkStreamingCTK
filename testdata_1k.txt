Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.

Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.

Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.

Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.

Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.

Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.

Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.

Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.

Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.

Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.

Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
Here, we report that CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a broad panel of DLBCL celllines, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models established from ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and stimulatesIL-2 production in primary T-cells. These activities are dependent on the binding of CC-122 to Cereblon andsubsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, resulting in direct de-repression ofinterferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription and induction of interferon inducible proteins, ultimately leading toapoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate for the first time by using inducible gene silencing that Aiolosnegatively regulates transcription of ISGs in both ABC and GCB DLBCL cell lines. Furthermore, our findings wereconfirmed in a clinical setting, where administration of CC-122 to R/R-DLBCL patients resulted in decreasedlevels of Aiolos and Ikaros and increased IRF7 staining in lymph node biopsies and increased T-cell co-stimulation. Finally, our results provide a mechanistic rationale for the future clinical development of CC-122 inDLBCL and define a pathway that is not targeted by current therapeutic agents.
Materials and Methods:(See experimental supplemental procedures for detail).Cell Culture, shRNA Lentivirus Production, Generation of Stable Cell LinesMethods for cell culture, lentivirus transduction and generation of stable cell lines were described previously. 16,17.Plasmid information and shRNA targeting sequences are available in the supplemental information.
Results:CC-122 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ABC and GCB DLBCL. To explore the anti-proliferative activity of CC-122 in DLBCL cell lines, thymidine incorporation assays were performed in a panel ofDLBCL cell lines after 5 days of treatment with CC-122. Exposure of four ABC-DLBCL lines (TMD8, U2932, Rivaand OCI-LY10) and five GCB-DLBCL lines (Karpas 422, WSU-DLCL2, SUDHL-4, OCI-LY19 and Pfeiffer) celllines with 0.01 to 10,000 nM CC-122 for 5 days led to a marked decrease in proliferation (Figure 1A). The ABCcell lines were more sensitive than the GCB cell lines (ABC IC50 range  8 nΜ to 6 μΜ; GCB IC50 range  1 μΜ to&gt;10 μΜ).
We next explored if this decreased proliferation eventually led to apoptosis in ABC and GCB-DLBCL celllines. Treatment of 0.1 to 10 μΜ CC-122 for 7 days, resulted in a dose dependent induction of apoptosis in GCB(WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422) and ABC cell lines (TMD8 and OCI-LY10) between 4.5 to 6.5 fold compared toDMSO) as measured by Annexin V and To-Pro 3 flow cytometry (Figure 1B, left:  flow cytometry scatter plot;Figure 1B, right: graphical representation of flow cytometry data). Importantly, apoptosis in these cell lines wasobserved at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1 μΜ CC-122 15.
CC-122 promotes Cereblon-Ikaros interaction and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Aiolos andIkaros in vitro. The thalidomide binding domain of Cereblon was recently shown to contain a hydrophobic pocketin which three tryptophan residues govern the binding with the glutarimide moiety within thalidomide, lenalidomideand pomalidomide 9. As the chemical structure of CC-122 contains a glutarimide ring, we explored if CC-122binds Cereblon. As shown in Figure 2A, Cereblon from U266 multiple myeloma cell extracts interacted with FGaffinity beads coupled to an immobilized thalidomide analog (DMSO control lane). Furthermore, incubation of thecomplex with increasing concentration of free CC-122 resulted in the displacement of Cereblon from thethalidomide analog-immobilized beads, consistent with CC-122 competing with thalidomide for binding Cereblon.Additionally, fluorescence quenching studies on a purified C-terminus fragment of Cereblon (a.a. 321-440)confirmed direct binding of CC-122 with Cereblon (Figure S1).
Immunomodulatory drugs in multiple myeloma cells have been shown to recruit Aiolos and Ikaros andinduce their ubiquitination by the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent proteasomaldegradation.  11,12. In order to assess the ability of CC-122 to recruit Ikaros to the CRL4CRBN  complex, wegenerated HEK293FT CRBN -/- utilizing the CRISPR gene editing system. Cell lysates from HEK293FT CRBN-/-cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (EV), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CRBN, or pcDNA3.1-HA-IKZF1were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of either DMSO or 20 µM CC-122. As shown inFigure 2B, CC-122 promoted the association of Ikaros to Cereblon, whereas DMSO did not. We next assessedwhether the increased association of Ikaros to Cereblon upon addition of CC-122 resulted in degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros in cells. In three DLBCL cell lines (TMD8, OCI-LY10 and Karpas 422) treated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 12 hours there was decreased protein abundance of Aiolos and Ikaros in a concentration dependentmanner (Figure 2C). In contrast, gene expression analysis of Ikaros or Aiolos demonstrated no change in themRNA levels (data not shown), suggesting the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros was primarily at the proteinlevel and not secondary to reduced transcription. To demonstrate the decreased protein degradation occurredindependent of protein synthesis, we assessed the effects of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein half-life bytreating U2932 cells with cycloheximide to inhibit production of nascent polypeptides, followed by treatment withDMSO or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1.5, 3 and 6 hours. Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels were stable in the DMSO treatedcells, indicating a normal half-life greater than six hours, while a 36 to 72 percent decrease for Aiolos and a 39 to73 percent decrease in Ikaros protein abundance was observed at 1.5 and 3 hours after CC-122 treatment,indicating a significantly shorter protein half life in the presence of the drug (Figure 2D). These data underscorethat degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros occur at the protein level and do not involve changes in transcription ortranslation.
To test the functional requirement of Cereblon for CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, wegenerated stably transduced OCI-LY10 cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox) inducible shRNA targeting CRBN orluciferase mRNA respectively. Expression of the CRBN shRNA resulted in a considerable decrease in Cereblonprotein levels, with a concomitant reduction in CC-122-dependent degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros (Figure 2E). Incontrast,  the control luciferase shRNA  affected neither Cereblon levels nor degradation of the two substrates.
We next investigated the dependence of CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros on the enzymaticactivity of the E3 ligase complex. For this, we pretreated a separate ABC-DLBCL cell line, TMD8, for 1 hour withMLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of Cullin-RING E3 ligase activity (NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor), priorto a six hour exposure of CC-122. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Cullin-RING E3 ligase resulted in ablockade of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation (Figure 2F). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Cereblon isthe molecular target of CC-122, CC-122 binding to Cereblon recruits Aiolos/Ikaros to CRL4CRBN and that E3 ligaseenzymatic activity is necessary for ubiquitination of Aiolos and Ikaros and thus their proteasomal degradationinduced by CC-122.
CC-122 promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL xenografts andDLBCL patients. We next examined the ability of CC-122 to inhibit DLBCL xenograft growth in vivo. Treatment offemale CB-17 SCID mice with CC-122 at 3 or 30 mg/kg once daily significantly decreased tumor growth in OCI-LY10 ABC-DLBCL (p=0.028 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 3A) and WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL derivedxenograft models (p&lt;0.01) (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle control. In a separate study, we assessed theability of CC-122 to promote degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos in vivo. In the 21 day efficacy study of WSU-DLCL2xenograft transplanted mice, tumors were excised one, six or twenty-four hours post final dosing. Aiolos andIkaros expression were interrogated through immunohistochemistry and was found to be decreased 64% and30% respectively compared to vehicle within one hour of treatment, with a maximal reduction of 94% and 69%respectively observed at six hours (Figure 3C,D). Aiolos and Ikaros levels partially recovered 24 hours post-dosing with protein level within 20% and 34% of vehicle,  respectively. The 24 hour post-dose Aiolos and Ikarosexpression represents the trough compound level following multiple doses of CC-122. When the 1 hour time pointis compared to the 24 hour post-dose time point there is a significant reduction in Aiolos but not Ikarosexpression, however, at the 6 hour time point both transcription factors are significantly different from the 24 hourtime point. Taken together, these data reveal that CC-122 inhibited DLBCL tumor growth in vivo and that thisactivity was associated with the degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL xenograftmodels.
We next compared expression of Cereblon, Aiolos or Ikaros protein levels by immunohistochemistry onFFPE samples from 20 DLBCL, 5 tonsils and 10 normal lymph node biopsies. Interestingly, normal germinalcenter B-cells exhibited modestly higher levels of Cereblon expression compared to DLBCL cells (mean H scoreof 256 and 208) (p=0.024). However, there were no significant differences between lymphoma cells and normalgerminal center B-cells with respect to the expression levels of Aiolos (mean H score of 198 and 211,respectively) and Ikaros (mean H score of 175 and 179, respectively) (Figure S2A,B). To explore the associationof COO molecular subtypes to Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros expression, we utilized the Hans classification schemetogether with IHC staining for these three proteins on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 90 FFPE samples fromDLBCL patients. As shown in representative images in Figure 3E, Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros were expressed inboth GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. IRF-4 protein expression, as expected, was observed at much higher levels inthe non-GCB subtype.
Finally, we analyzed lymph node biopsies from relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL patients enrolled in asingle arm CC-122 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01421524) and administered drug at a dose of 3mg once daily. Biopsies taken from two GCB patients at baseline and after approximately 15 days of daily dosingwere subjected to IHC staining for Cereblon, Aiolos and Ikaros. IHC staining was positive at baseline in multiplerepresentative biopsies for all three markers (Figure 3F). Exposure to CC-122 reduced expression levels of Aiolosand Ikaros in each patient by 25-50% demonstrating the utility of these two proteins as pharmacodynamicmarkers of CC-122.
CC-122 mimics interferon signaling in DLBCL. To gain insight into the molecular basis of CC-122 activity inDLBCL cells, we performed gene expression profiling on OCI-LY10 cells treated with DMSO or 1 μΜ CC-122 for18 hours to identify CC-122 modulated genes. Comparison of OCI-LY10 cells exposed to 1 μΜ CC-122 versusthe corresponding DMSO control yielded 1374 significantly differentially expressed probes (805 up-regulated and569 down-regulated vs. DMSO; Table S1). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified a significant association ofCC-122 with 31 upregulated pathway-based gene categories (Table S2), including autoimmune signaling, celladhesion molecules, glutathione metabolism and negative regulators of RIG I. Interestingly, a signature of type Iinterferon signaling (REACTOME_INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, FDR = 0.001335) (Figure 4A) washighly represented in CC-122 treated cells compared to DMSO. To validate this observation, OCI-LY10 cells weretreated with 1 or 10 μΜ CC-122 or positive control interferon alpha (IFNα) for 6 or 24 hours. We observedtranscriptional upregulation of IRF7 and two other representative interferon stimulated genes with defined pro-apoptotic functions of caspase 3 activation and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, IFI27 and XAF118,19, at the mRNA level within six hours (Figure S3A) or twenty-four hours (Figure S3B) of treatment. We nextconfirmed that CC-122 increased the protein levels of IRF7 and two additional interferon regulated proteins, IFIT3and DDX58, concomitant with Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 4B). Amodest downregulation of IRF4 was also observed in the ABC cell lines treated with CC-122. In xenograft miceimplanted with the WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cell line, we confirmed these findings as IRF7 levels assessed byIHC were found to increase when the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg CC-122 to the vehicle control (Figure4C; Top panel). Furthermore, after approximately 15 days of CC-122 administration in a non-GCB R/R-DLBCLpatient resulted in increased intra-tumoral IRF7 levels compared to the baseline lymph node biopsy (Figure 4C;bottom panel). To test if the treatment with CC-122 led to production and/or secretion of interferon, we measuredsecretion of IFNα or IFNγ by ELISA, 72 hours after CC-122 treatment in Karpas 422 and OCI-LY10 cells.Surprisingly, no increase in secretion of either IFNα or IFNγ (Figure 4D) and no increase in the transcription ofIFNβ1 mRNA (Figure S3B) was observed. These results suggest CC-122 mediated effects on the interferonpathway was independent of autocrine type I and II interferon secretion and signaling.
Ikaros family transcription factors are known to negatively regulate transcription of target genes throughdirect interaction with the DNA near the transcriptional start site affecting chromatin remodeling. Ikaros and Aiolosrepress transcription through two different mechanisms: by the recruitment of the Mi-2β containing NuRD complexresulting in histone deacetylation 20,21, and by modulating the basal transcriptional machinery in a non-HDACmechanism through interactions with CtBP and CtIP 22. The Karpas 422 cells (GCB-DLBCL) do not express IRF4and enables elucidation of the effects of Aiolos on ISG stimulation independent of  B cell differentiation. To furtherunderstand the specific role of Aiolos in CC-122 mediated up-regulation of the interferon regulated proteins, wegenerated Karpas 422 cell lines stably transduced with inducible shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase(shLuc) as a control or Aiolos mRNA via two unique shRNA constructs (shAiolos 1023 and shAiolos 5472). Asshown in Figure 4E, induction of shRNAs targeting Aiolos but not luciferase in Karpas 422 cells with doxycycline(Dox) led to a 2 fold decrease in Aiolos protein levels at 3 days. Additionally, in shRNA cell lines where Aiolos wasreduced, a concomitant increase in IRF7, DDX58 and IFIT3 protein was observed (Figure 4E). Finally, analysis ofAiolos ChIP-Seq 23 performed in DF15 multiple myeloma cells demonstrated positive binding of Aiolos to the IRF7transcriptional start site (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results show that CC-122 activates genes in theinterferon pathway by promoting Aiolos degradation in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines, likely by removingtheir repressive activity on the interferon stimulated genes (ISG).
Differential activities of CC-122 and lenalidomide in DLBCL. Lenalidomide has demonstrated potent activity inclinical trials with R/R DLBCL subjects, especially in the ABC subtype  24-26. Our previous pre-clinical studies alsodemonstrated that lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLCBL cell lines 16. In contrast, CC-122 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in both ABC- and GCB-DLBCL celllines, thus we wanted to explore the potential difference in the underlying mechanisms for the differential effectsexhibited by the two drugs.
 We next investigated the relative abundance of various proteins in WSU-DLCL2 GCB-DLBCL cells aftertreatment with 10 µM CC-122 or 10 µM lenalidomide.  In this experiment, total proteins were isolated from drugtreated cells and analyzed by Tandem Mass Tag Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) and log2 ratios of relative proteinabundance from the two treatments were compared. Scatter plots of the mass spectrometric data from ABCTMD8 cells demonstrated that those proteins which increased in relative abundance at 24 and 72 hours, includingthe interferon regulated proteins, were commonly regulated by lenalidomide and CC-122 with r2 values of 0.752and 0.746 (Figure 5A). Additionally, proteomics were performed on WSU-DLCL2 cells treated with equivalentconcentrations of CC-122 and lenalidomide for 24 and 72 hours. Strikingly, while CC-122 treatment increased therelative abundance of interferon stimulated proteins such as IFIT3 and DDX58 by 5 to15 fold, exposure tolenalidomide did not result in increased levels of these proteins. Moreover, the r2 values comparing CC-122 andlenalidomide treatments in WSU-DLCL2 were 0.517 and 0.488 indicating a greater difference in the effects of thetwo drugs in GCB cells compared to ABC cells. To confirm the findings, validation experiments were performed inWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 cells treated with DMSO, lenalidomide (1-10 μΜ) and CC-122 (1-10 μΜ) for 72 hours. Asshown in Figure 5B, lenalidomide treatment did not result in increased IRF7 and DDX58 protein levels in thesecells, whereas treatment with CC-122 dramatically increased their abundance. TMD8 cells treated withlenalidomide slightly increased levels of IRF7 and DDX58 compared to DMSO, while CC-122 greatly increasedthe abundance of these proteins. Additionally, in both cells lines CC-122 promoted a much greater reduction inthe levels of Aiolos and Ikaros compared to lenalidomide.
 Next, we explored differences in rate of degradation between CC-122 and lenalidomide. We treatedWSU-DLCL2 and TMD8 with DMSO, 10 μΜ lenalidomide or 10 μΜ CC-122 for 1, 6 and 12 hours andimmunoblotted for Aiolos and Ikaros. As shown in Figure 5C, lenalidomide induced Aiolos and Ikaros degradationof 33-43% and 23-31% in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively, whereas CC-122 mediated degradation of Aiolosand Ikaros by 78-80% and 52-70% within 12 hours in WSU-DLCL2 and TMD8, respectively. These resultsdemonstrate a concentration and time dependent difference between lenalidomide and CC-122 in the rate andextent of Aiolos and Ikaros degradation in GCB cells and corresponding changes in upregulation of ISGtranscription and abundance of proteins. Finally, we compared the ability of CC-122 and lenalidomide to induceapoptosis in the ABC TMD8 cells and two GCB cell lines, WSU-DLCL2 and Karpas 422. Lenalidomide treatmentin the TMD8 cells resulted in a 2 fold increase in apoptosis, while there was no measureable increase in either theWSU-DLCL2 or Karpas 422 cells. By contrast, CC-122 induced apoptosis from 4 to 8.5 fold in each of the threecell lines compared to DMSO (Figure 5D). These data suggest a potential mechanism for the broader spectrum ofCC-122 activity in DLBCL encompassing GCB-DLBCL.
CC-122 co-stimulates T cells via Aiolos and Ikaros degradation. Aiolos and Ikaros have been described asrepressors of IL-2 expression and secretion, a marker of activation in primary T-cells 13,21,27. Given thedegradation observed of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL cells, we investigated the effects of CC-122 treatment on IL-2 expression in primary T-cells. Exposure of CD3 stimulated purified T-cells from 3 donors to variousconcentrations of CC-122 led to a dramatic increase in IL-2 expression and secretion (Figure 6A). We nextexamined the effect of CC-122 on Aiolos and Ikaros protein expression in anti-CD3 stimulated primary human Tcells treated with DMSO or 1 µM CC-122 for 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours. Degradation of both Aiolos and Ikaros wasobserved as early as 1 hour after drug treatment and a decrease of Aiolos and Ikaros of 96% and 81%,respectively, at 6 hours (Figure 6B). Furthermore, a thirty minute pre-treatment with MG-132, a proteasomeinhibitor, stabilized Aiolos and Ikaros confirming degradation was mediated through the proteasome.
We extended our studies further to investigate CC-122 effects on Aiolos degradation in peripheral T cellsfrom R/R DLBCL patients receiving 3 mg once daily dose in the phase I trial. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) isolated from whole blood samples collected immediately prior to CC-122 administration and 1.5 and 5hours post a single CC-122 dose were analyzed for Aiolos expression by flow cytometric analysis. In CD3+ T-cells a median decrease of 27% and 48% in Aiolos expression was observed at 1.5 and 5 hrs post-dosing,respectively compared to baseline samples (Figure 6C). Additionally, ex vivo anti-CD3 stimulation of whole blooddrawn prior to or 1.5 hours after a single dose of CC-122 administration, led to a median increase in IL-2 levels of477% in the 1.5 hour samples compared to baseline pre-treatment (Figure 6D). These combined resultsdemonstrate that CC-122 is a potent co-stimulator of T-cells both in vitro and in DLBCL patients.
Discussion:In this study we describe the activity of a new chemical entity, CC-122, with broad cytotoxic activity in DLBCLindependent of cell of origin, as well as immunomodulatory activity. Although CC-122 binds and utilizes acommon target, Cereblon, shared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, recent crystallographic data demonstratehow structurally distinct IMiD compounds evoke different cellular, and molecularly defined responses, yet bind thesame target. Additional recent studies on the immunomodulatory agents have elucidated, in part, the mechanismof action in multiple myeloma cells and primary T-cells 11-13.  Both activities involve drug binding to Cereblon andsubsequent degradation of substrate proteins, specifically the transcription factors Aiolos and Ikaros, mediated bythe CRL4CRBN E3 ligase complex. The Ikaros family of transcription factors comprises proteins with zinc-fingerdomain mediated DNA binding capabilities and serve as key regulators of lineage commitment in lymphoidprogenitor cells, and lymphoid differentiation 28,29. However, their precise role in B cell malignancies such asmultiple myeloma and lymphoma is yet to be defined.
In this study based on our cumulative observations, we propose a hypothetical model for CC-122 activity(Figure 7) whereby CC-122 binding to CRBN results in the increased ability of CRL4CRBN to recruit Aiolos andIkaros, resulting in 1) activation of T-cells and 2) derepression of interferon stimulated genes leading totumoricidal activity in DLBCL (Figure 7).
Previous pre-clinical studies indicated lenalidomide had preferential anti-proliferative activity in ABC-DLBCL cell lines versus GCB-DLBCL cell lines 16,30. Interestingly, a retrospective analysis of two single agentlenalidomide R/R-DLBCL clinical trials 24,25 comparing cell of origin classification by Han’s IHC algorithm to clinicalresponse indicated a significant difference in the response of non-GCB patients versus GCB patients. Overallresponse rate (ORR) was 52.9% (non-GCB) versus 8.7% (GCB) (p=0.006) and complete response rate was23.5% compared to 4.3%, respectively. In a separate single agent lenalidomide clinical trial, patients weresubtyped by gene expression profiling. ABC-DLBCL patients treated with lenalidomide when compared to GCBpatients showed greater improvements in ORR (45.5% vs 21.4%), progression free survival (82 weeks vs 13.2weeks) and overall survival (108.4 weeks vs 30 weeks) 26. In contrast to lenalidomide, CC-122 appears topossess broader cell autonomous activity than lenalidomide, spanning both the ABC- and GCB-DLBCL subtypes.While the precise mechanism is not fully known, we suggest two possibilities to explain the differential activity ofCC-122 and lenalidomide. First, although CC-122 and lenalidomide both mediate destruction of Aiolos and Ikaros,there may be distinct substrates for each drug as hypothesized by Chamberlain et al 9. In fact, a lenalidomidespecific substrate, casein kinase 1 alpha, which is not affected by CC-122 was identified in our proteomicsexperiment (Figure 5A). It is possible that CC-122 utilizes specific and unique substrates to mediate some of itsbiological effects distinct from lenalidomide. Identification and characterization of new substrates may helpsubstantiate this hypothesis. Secondly, while previous work highlighted the role of IRF4 regulation in the inductionof an interferon autocrine loop in response to lenalidomide 30, our data refine this mechanism by describing adirect regulation of ISG by Aiolos independent of IRF4 and interferon secretion. CC-122’s activity in GCB-DLBCLmay be an indication of greater ISG promoter occupancy, and thus repression, by Aiolos in GCB compared toABC-DLBCL, as CC-122 induces a greater depth and faster kinetics of Aiolos degradation than lenalidomide. Thishypothesis would require a differential dependence on Aiolos repressive activities between the two molecularsubtypes and the ability to degrade this substrate below a threshold in GCB-DLBCL that lenalidomide cannotattain, as we have not observed differences in expression of Aiolos between GCB and non-GCB patient biopsies(Figure S4).
 Our results have additional implications for the clinical development of CC-122 in DLBCL. For example,we demonstrate in our studies that a classical “double hit” lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) 31 is sensitive to CC-122 and that c-myc protein levels are reduced after CC-122 treatment (Figure S5). A segment of high risk DLBCLpatients defined by gene rearrangements or elevated protein levels of c-myc in combination with BCL2 or BCL6expression and are associated with a particularly poor prognosis when receiving R-CHOP 32,33. In mouse B and T-cells, Aiolos and Ikaros are direct transcriptional repressors of the c-myc promoter 20,34. While c-myc protein levelsare decreased in response to CC-122 mediated degradation of these two substrates, the Karpas 422 cell line hasa c-myc rearrangement suggesting the c-myc downregulation is partially mediated through indirect mechanism(s).These observations highlight that additional studies are needed to understand the possible role of c-mycregulation by Aiolos and Ikaros in this specific disease subset and may warrant further clinical investigation of CC-122 in this high risk population.
